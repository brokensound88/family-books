# Plan of Attack for FamilyBooks

## **Overview**

The **FamilyBooks** is an iOS-first mobile application designed to empower families to manage their finances, sync multiple financial accounts (bank, superannuation, savings, investments), educate children on saving and investing, and balance household budgets with a visually stunning, gamified interface. Built using **Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM)** for shared business logic and **SwiftUI** for the iOS user interface, the app leverages modern tools and AI-assisted development in **Windsurf** and **Cursor** IDEs to streamline vibe-coding. This document outlines a strategic plan to develop, test, and launch the app, with provisions for future Android expansion using Jetpack Compose. The plan emphasizes rapid prototyping, iterative development, and a focus on delivering a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) within 6–11 months, followed by Android implementation.

## **Objectives**

- **Primary Goal**: Launch a polished iOS app with native SwiftUI performance, integrating financial APIs (Plaid, Yodlee, FinanceKit), vibrant dashboards, and kid-friendly educational features.
- **Secondary Goal**: Prepare shared KMM logic for seamless Android expansion, minimizing rework.
- **Vibe-Coding Workflow**: Leverage AI tools in Windsurf and Cursor (e.g., GitHub Copilot, AI code suggestions) to accelerate coding, prototyping, and debugging.
- **Success Metrics**:
  - Achieve 1,000+ active users within 3 months of iOS launch.
  - Maintain App Store rating of 4.5+ stars.
  - Ensure 90-day retention rate of 40%+.
  - Enable 50%+ code reuse for Android implementation.

   - Analyze competitors (Monarch Money, YNAB, Greenlight) for gaps, focusing on family collaboration and superannuation tracking.
   - Identify Australian bank/super fund support via Plaid/Yodlee.
2. **Development Environment Setup** (1 week):
   - Install Windsurf and Cursor IDEs on macOS.
   - Configure KMM plugin in IntelliJ (Windsurf’s base IDE) for shared Kotlin logic.
   - Set up Xcode for SwiftUI development, linked to KMM module.
   - Enable GitHub Copilot in both IDEs for AI-assisted coding.
   - Initialize Git repository for version control.
3. **API and Compliance Planning** (1–2 weeks):
   - Apply for Plaid/Yodlee API access (plaid.com, yodlee.com).
   - Request FinanceKit entitlement from Apple (developer.apple.com).
   - Consult legal experts for PCI DSS, GDPR, and Australia’s Privacy Act compliance.
4. **Prototyping Tools** (1 week):
   - Set up Figma with Magician/Builder.io plugins for AI-generated wireframes.
   - Configure AWS account for SageMaker (AI categorization) and Firebase for backend.

#### **Deliverables**

- Market research report with user feedback.
- Configured Windsurf/Cursor IDEs with KMM and SwiftUI.
- API access keys for Plaid/Yodlee, Firebase setup.
- Initial Figma wireframes for 3–5 key screens (dashboard, budget, kids’ module).

#### **Vibe-Coding Integration**

- Use Cursor’s AI suggestions to scaffold KMM project structure (e.g., `shared` module with data models).
- Leverage Windsurf’s IntelliJ-based code completion for Kotlin logic, enhanced by Copilot prompts like:

  ```kotlin
  // Create a Kotlin data class for Transaction with amount, date, and category
  ```

### **Phase 2: Design and Prototyping (4–6 Weeks)**

#### **Objectives**

- Create visually stunning SwiftUI wireframes and prototypes.
- Validate UX with target users.
- Plan Android UI for future consistency.

#### **Tasks**

1. **Wireframing with AI** (2 weeks):
   - Use Figma + Magician to generate wireframes with prompts like:
     - “iOS dashboard with colorful net worth chart, budget cards, and gamified kids’ section.”
     - “Kid education screen with animated savings jars and stock portfolio.”
   - Refine designs to include SF Symbols, vibrant gradients, and accessibility features.
2. **Prototyping** (1–2 weeks):
   - Build clickable Figma prototypes for key flows (e.g., account syncing → budget creation → kids’ goal setting).
   - Test with 10–20 families for feedback on usability and visual appeal.
3. **SwiftUI Code Generation** (1–2 weeks):
   - Use Builder.io’s Visual Copilot to export Figma designs to SwiftUI code.
   - Example output:

     ```swift
     struct BudgetCard: View {
         @State private var isTapped = false
         var body: some View {
             VStack {
                 Text("Monthly Budget")
                     .font(.headline)
                 Text("$5,000")
                     .font(.title)
                     .foregroundColor(.green)
             }
             .padding()
             .background(LinearGradient(gradient: Gradient(colors: [.blue, .purple]), startPoint: .top, endPoint: .bottom))
             .cornerRadius(10)
             .scaleEffect(isTapped ? 1.05 : 1.0)
             .animation(.spring(), value: isTapped)
             .onTapGesture { isTapped.toggle() }
         }
     }
     ```

- User feedback report from prototype testing.
- Jetpack Compose UI sketches for future Android implementation.

#### **Vibe-Coding Integration**

- In Cursor, use AI to refine SwiftUI code with prompts like:

  ```swift
  // Add a SwiftUI Chart view for spending by category with animated bars
  ```

- In Windsurf, leverage KMM templates to stub shared logic (e.g., budget calculations), using Copilot for rapid prototyping.

### **Phase 3: Development (12–18 Weeks)**

#### **Objectives**

     data class Budget(val id: String, val name: String, val amount: Double, val spent: Double)
     ```

   - Build API clients for Plaid/Yodlee:

     ```kotlin
     expect interface TransactionRepository {
         suspend fun fetchTransactions(accountId: String): List<Transaction>
     }
     actual class TransactionRepositoryImpl : TransactionRepository {
         actual suspend fun fetchTransactions(accountId: String): List<Transaction> {
             val response = PlaidApi.getTransactions(accountId)
             return response.map { it.toTransaction() }
         }
     }
     ```

   - Integrate AWS SageMaker for AI-driven transaction categorization:

         @Published var netWorth: Double = 0.0
         func loadData() async {
             let accounts = try? await FinanceStore.shared.accounts()
             netWorth = accounts?.reduce(0.0) { $0 + $1.balance } ?? 0.0
         }
     }
     ```

   - Add Core ML for optional on-device categorization.
3. **Security and Compliance (2 weeks)**:
   - Implement end-to-end encryption in Kotlin API calls.
   - Use Keychain Services in SwiftUI:

     ```swift

     func saveCredentials(token: String) {
         let data = token.data(using: .utf8)!
         let query: [String: Any] = [kSecClass as String: kSecClassGenericPassword,
                                     kSecAttrAccount as String: "userToken",
                                     kSecValueData as String: data]

## **Timeline and Cost Estimate**

- **Timeline**:
  - Phases 1–5 (iOS MVP): 6–11 months.
  - Phase 6 (Android): 2–3 months.
- **Cost**:
  - iOS MVP: $120,000–$450,000.
  - Android: $50,000–$150,000.
  - Ongoing: $20,000–$70,000/year (APIs, maintenance).
- **Resources**:
  - 2–3 developers (Kotlin/Swift expertise).
  - 1 UI/UX designer for Figma.
  - 1 DevOps for Firebase/AWS.

## **Risks and Mitigation**

- **Risk**: Limited KMM expertise.
  - **Mitigation**: Use Windsurf’s KMM templates and Cursor’s AI to accelerate learning.
- **Risk**: FinanceKit limitations for non-Apple Wallet accounts.
  - **Mitigation**: Rely on Plaid/Yodlee for broad coverage.
- **Risk**: User adoption challenges.
  - **Mitigation**: Focus on vibrant UI and kid engagement, validated via beta testing.

## **Vibe-Coding Workflow**

- **Windsurf**: Use IntelliJ’s KMM support for shared logic, with Copilot for rapid Kotlin development. Leverage code templates for API clients and data models.
- **Cursor**: Utilize AI-driven code generation for SwiftUI views and tests, with prompts tailored to your app’s features (e.g., “animated budget chart”).
- **AI Tools**: Integrate Figma + Magician/Builder.io for wireframes, exported to SwiftUI via Cursor.
- **Iterative Development**: Code small features in sprints (e.g., one screen per week), using AI to prototype and refine.

## **Next Steps**

1. Set up Windsurf/Cursor with KMM and SwiftUI projects.
2. Generate initial Figma wireframes for dashboard and kids’ module.
3. Start KMM module with Plaid/Yodlee API integration.
4. Code SwiftUI dashboard in Cursor, using AI-generated code.

This plan ensures a streamlined, vibe-coding approach to deliver a visually stunning iOS app, with KMM enabling future Android expansion.
