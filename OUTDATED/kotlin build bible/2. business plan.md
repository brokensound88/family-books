# Business Plan for FamilyBooks

## **Executive Summary**

**FamilyBooks** is an innovative, iOS-first mobile application designed to empower families to manage their finances, sync multiple financial accounts (bank, superannuation, savings, investments), educate children on saving and investing, and balance household budgets through a visually stunning, gamified interface. Built using **Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM)** for shared business logic and **SwiftUI** for a native iOS user interface, the app leverages AI-assisted development in **Windsurf** and **Cursor** IDEs to streamline vibe-coding. The app targets families seeking a comprehensive financial tool that combines budgeting, investment tracking, and financial literacy for kids, with a focus on the Australian market for superannuation integration. Future expansion to Android using Jetpack Compose will broaden its reach. The business aims to capture a niche in the growing personal finance market, projected to reach $2.8 billion globally by 2027, by offering a unique blend of family collaboration and kid-focused education. Revenue will be generated through a freemium model, premium subscriptions, family plans, and affiliate partnerships, targeting 10,000 active users within 12 months of launch and $500,000 in annual recurring revenue (ARR) by year two.
