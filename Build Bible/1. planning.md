# Planning Document for FamilyBooks

## **Overview**

**FamilyBooks** is an iOS 18-first mobile application designed to empower families to manage their finances, synchronize bank accounts, superannuation (with a focus on the Australian market), savings, and investment accounts, educate children on saving and investing, and balance household budgets through a visually stunning, gamified interface. Built entirely in **Swift** and **SwiftUI** leveraging the latest iOS 18 features, the app targets iPhone and iPad users, with potential future macOS expansion using Mac Catalyst. Development will utilize **Windsurf** (configured as a Swift-focused IDE) and **Cursor** (an AI-driven IDE) for vibe-coding, harnessing AI tools like GitHub Copilot and Figma plugins (Magician, Builder.io) to accelerate wireframing, code generation, and prototyping. This Planning Document outlines the strategic roadmap, timeline, budget, team structure, risk management, and development approach for the app’s Minimum Viable Product (MVP), ensuring a modern, principled, and scalable foundation. The plan aligns with Apple’s ecosystem, incorporating iOS 18 frameworks (e.g., FinanceKit, CoreML, LocalAuthentication for FaceID) and financial APIs (Plaid, Yodlee), while adhering to PCI DSS, GDPR, and Australia’s Privacy Act. The document is tailored for vibe-coding workflows, providing a clear blueprint to streamline development.

## **Objectives**

- Deliver an iOS 18 MVP within 6–9 months, focusing on core features: financial account syncing, budgeting, kids’ education, investment tracking, and family collaboration.
- Leverage Swift/SwiftUI and modern iOS 18 frameworks (e.g., FinanceKit, SwiftData, WidgetKit) for a native, high-performance experience.
- Create a visually stunning, accessible, and gamified UI optimized for families and kids (ages 8–18).
- Ensure compliance with Apple’s App Store guidelines, PCI DSS, GDPR, and Australia’s Privacy Act.
- Utilize Windsurf and Cursor for AI-assisted vibe-coding to accelerate prototyping and development.
- Prepare infrastructure for potential macOS expansion and future feature iterations.
- Achieve a 4.5+ App Store rating through user-centric design and robust functionality.

## **Strategic Roadmap**

## **Development Approach**

### **Methodology**

- **Agile with Sprints**: 2-week sprints for iterative development, with daily stand-ups via Slack.
- **Vibe-Coding Focus**: Leverage Windsurf and Cursor for rapid prototyping, using AI prompts to generate code and designs.
  - Example Prompt (Windsurf): “Generate Swift code for a budget repository using SwiftData.”
  - Example Prompt (Cursor): “Create a SwiftUI view for a kid’s savings goal with animated progress.”

### **Tools and Frameworks**

- **Windsurf**: Swift-focused IDE with Copilot for code generation.
- **Cursor**: AI-driven IDE for SwiftUI prototyping and debugging.
- **Xcode 16**: Primary environment for iOS 18 development, testing, and deployment.
- **Figma + Magician/Builder.io**: AI-assisted wireframing and SwiftUI export.
- **Swift 5.9+**: Latest language features (e.g., concurrency with async/await).
- **SwiftUI**: Native UI framework for iOS 18, with `Chart`, `Animation`, and accessibility.
- **iOS 18 Frameworks**:
  - **FinanceKit**: For Apple Wallet account syncing.
  - **SwiftData**: For local data persistence.
  - **CoreML**: For on-device transaction categorization.
  - **LocalAuthentication**: For FaceID authentication.
  - **WidgetKit**: For home screen widgets.
  - **StoreKit**: For in-app purchases.
- **APIs**: Plaid, Yodlee for financial data, Stripe for payments.

### **Risk Management**

- **Risks and Mitigation**:
  - **API Downtime**: Plaid/Yodlee outages could delay syncing. Mitigation: Implement offline caching with SwiftData and test fallback mechanisms.
  - **Apple Review Rejection**: Non-compliance with App Store guidelines. Mitigation: Pre-submit with Fastlane and validate with Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines.
  - **Budget Overrun**: Unexpected costs (e.g., API fees). Mitigation: Maintain 10–15% contingency fund.
  - **Team Skill Gaps**: Lack of SwiftUI expertise. Mitigation: Provide training and leverage Cursor’s AI assistance.
- **Contingency Plan**:
  - Extend timeline by 1 month if development lags.
  - Outsource design or testing if resources are stretched.

## **Resource Allocation**

- **Human Resources**: 5–6 team members, with flexible part-time roles.
- **Tools**:
  - Windsurf/Cursor: $300–$600/year.
  - Figma: $150–$300/year.
  - Firebase/AWS: $1,000–$7,000/year.
- **Infrastructure**:
  - Mac Mini or M2 MacBook for development ($1,000–$2,000).
  - Cloud credits for Firebase/AWS testing ($500–$1,000).

## **Success Metrics**

- **Timeline Adherence**: Complete MVP by July 2026.
- **Budget Compliance**: Stay within $100,000–$400,000.
- **User Feedback**: 90%+ positive response from prototype validation.
- **Performance**: App loads in <2 seconds, API responses <500ms.
