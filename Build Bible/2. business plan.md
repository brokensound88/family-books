# Business Plan Document for FamilyBooks

## **Overview**

**FamilyBooks** is an innovative iOS 18-first mobile application designed to empower families to manage their finances, synchronize bank accounts, superannuation (with a focus on the Australian market), savings, and investment accounts, educate children on saving and investing, and balance household budgets through a visually stunning, gamified interface. Built entirely in **Swift** and **SwiftUI** leveraging the latest iOS 18 capabilities, the app targets iPhone and iPad users, with potential future expansion to macOS via Mac Catalyst. Development will harness **Windsurf** (configured as a Swift-focused IDE) and **Cursor** (an AI-driven IDE) for vibe-coding, utilizing AI tools like GitHub Copilot and Figma plugins (Magician, Builder.io) to accelerate wireframing, code generation, and prototyping. This Business Plan Document outlines the business model, market analysis, revenue strategy, marketing plan, operational structure, financial projections, and growth strategy for **FamilyBooks**. The plan leverages Swift/SwiftUI’s native integration with iOS 18 frameworks (e.g., FinanceKit, CoreML, LocalAuthentication for FaceID, SwiftData, WidgetKit, StoreKit) and financial APIs (Plaid, Yodlee), ensuring compliance with PCI DSS, GDPR, and Australia’s Privacy Act. With a launch targeted for July 2026 (adjusted from the original plan due to the current date of August 27, 2025), the app aims to achieve a 4.5+ App Store rating and 10,000 active users within its first year.

## **Objectives**

- Launch an iOS 18 MVP by July 2026, offering core features: financial account syncing, budgeting, kids’ education, investment tracking, and family collaboration.
- Establish **FamilyBooks** as the leading family finance app in Australia, targeting 10,000 users by August 2027.
- Generate sustainable revenue through freemium models, in-app purchases, and premium subscriptions.
- Leverage Swift/SwiftUI and iOS 18 frameworks for a native, high-performance, and engaging user experience.
- Utilize Windsurf and Cursor for AI-assisted vibe-coding to optimize development efficiency.
- Ensure compliance with Apple’s App Store guidelines, financial regulations, and privacy laws.
- Plan for macOS expansion and international market growth post-MVP.
