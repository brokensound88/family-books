    - Enable Apple Sign-In and integrate with LocalAuthentication for FaceID.
    - Example:

      ```swift
      // ios/FamilyWealthBuilder/Services/AuthService.swift
      import AuthenticationServices
      class AuthService {
          func signInWithApple() async throws -> ASAuthorizationAppleIDCredential {
              let request = ASAuthorizationAppleIDProvider().createRequest()
              let authorization = try await ASAuthorizationController.preauthorizationController(for: request).authorization
              return authorization.credential as! ASAuthorizationAppleIDCredential
          }
      }
      ```

  - **Data Sync**:
    - Create zones: `users`, `transactions`, `budgets`, `savings_goals`, `portfolios`.
    - Set security rules:

      ```swift
      // CloudKit Security Rules (via CloudKit Dashboard)
      func evaluate(record: CKRecord) -> Bool {
          if record.recordType == "users" {
              return record.createdBy == record["userId"]
          }
          return true
      }
      ```

  - **Notifications**:
    - Enable push notifications for bill reminders and goal updates.
    - Example:

      ```swift
      // ios/FamilyWealthBuilder/Services/NotificationService.swift
      import UserNotifications
      class NotificationService {
          func scheduleBillReminder(bill: Bill) async {
              let content = UNMutableNotificationContent()
              content.title = "Bill Due"
              content.body = "\(bill.name) due on \(bill.dueDate)"
              let trigger = UNTimeIntervalNotificationTrigger(timeInterval: 86400, repeats: false)
              let request = UNNotificationRequest(identifier: bill.id, content: content, trigger: trigger)
              try? await UNUserNotificationCenter.current().add(request)
          }
      }
      ```

          }
      }
      ```

  - **Plaid/Yodlee**:
    - Obtain API keys, configure in `Info.plist`.
    - Example:

      ```swift
      // ios/FamilyWealthBuilder/Services/FinancialService.swift
      class FinancialService {
          private let plaidClient = PlaidClient(apiKey: "your-api-key")
          func fetchTransactions(accountId: String) async throws -> [Transaction] {
              return try await plaidClient.getTransactions(accountId: accountId)
          }
      }
      ```

  - **StoreKit**:
    - Set up in-app purchases for premium features.
    - Example:

      ```swift
      // ios/FamilyWealthBuilder/Services/PaymentService.swift
      import StoreKit
      class PaymentService {
          func purchasePremium() async throws -> Product.PurchaseResult {
              let products = try await StoreKit.Product.products(for: ["com.familywealthbuilder.premium"])
              return try await products[0].purchase()
          }
      }
      ```

- **Security Configuration**:
  - Enable TLS 1.3 for API calls.
  - Store keys in `Info.plist`, excluded from Git.
